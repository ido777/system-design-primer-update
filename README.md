# System Design Primer: GenAI Edition

## Introduction

Welcome to the **System Design Primer: Update Edition**. This project is an evolution of the original [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer), tailored for the new era of 2025 & Generative AI. Our goal is to provide dynamic, AI-assisted solutions that not only present system designs but also offer interactive tools to explore various architectural trade-offs. This approach aligns with the philosophy that system design interviews prioritize understanding trade-offs and fostering collaborative discussions over presenting fixed solutions.

## Key Features

- **Refactored into a course structure:** The original content is refactored into a course structure, with each chapter being a separate course.
- **Serve with the help of GitHub docs:** 
- **Deployable Examples:** Ready-to-use implementations that can be deployed using Docker, allowing users to experiment with real-world scenarios in cloud environments.
- **Mermaid Diagrams:** Transitioning from static images to [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) diagrams for system representations, facilitating easier modifications and better integration with markdown files.
- **Add some fair use content from 2 books:** 
### System Design Interview â€“ An insider's guide - Alex Xu
### Designing Distributed Systems: Patterns and Paradigms for Scalable, Reliable Systems Using Kubernetes 2nd Edition - Brendan Burns
- **Add some newer and more advanced gen AI generated information and links to ease your way into system design:** you are more than welcome to add your own notes and thoughts to the content. My goal is to make this a living document that every learner can and will contribute to - kind of self improving course :-).


# Course Overview

## Structure

The course is divided into the following modules:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of system design and the role of GenAI.
2. **Foundations of System Design**: Core principles and concepts.
3. **Core Components**: Detailed exploration of essential system components.
4. **Scalability and Reliability**: Strategies for building scalable and reliable systems.
5. **GenAI System Design**: Integrating Generative AI into system design.
6. **Real-World Case Studies**: Analysis of real-world system design examples.

## Learning Objectives

- Grasp fundamental and advanced system design concepts.
- Apply GenAI techniques to system design problems.
- Develop practical skills through hands-on examples and quizzes.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of computer science principles.
- Familiarity with programming concepts.
- Interest in AI and system design.

## Recommended Learning Path

It is advisable to follow the modules sequentially for a comprehensive understanding. However, each module is designed to be self-contained for targeted learning.



## Repository Structure

To maintain clarity and focus, the repository is organized as follows:

- **README.md:** Provides an overview of the project, its motivations, and key features.
- **Introduction.md** Introduction to the new format. Some of the content of the original readme is here.

- 
- **designs/**: Contains detailed system design documents, each exploring different architectures and their respective trade-offs.
- **solutions/**: Houses AI-generated solutions and interactive tools for various system design problems.
- **deployments/**: Includes Docker configurations and deployment scripts for hands-on experimentation with system implementations.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ido777/system-design-primer-update.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Designs:**
   Navigate to the `designs/` directory to delve into various system design documents and understand the considerations behind each approach.

3. **Interact with Solutions:**
   Utilize the tools in the `solutions/` directory to modify design parameters and observe the outcomes, enhancing your grasp of system design dynamics.

4. **Deploy and Experiment:**
   Use the resources in the `deployments/` directory to deploy sample systems in your preferred cloud environment, allowing for practical, hands-on learning.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions that align with our mission to provide dynamic, interactive, and insightful system design resources. Whether it's enhancing existing tools, adding new AI-generated solutions, or improving documentation, your input is valued.

## Bug Reports

For bug reports or requests [submit an issue](https://github.com/ido777/system-design-primer-update/issues).

## Pull Requests

The preferred way to contribute is to fork the
[main repository](https://github.com/ido777/system-design-primer-update) on GitHub.

1. Fork the [main repository](https://github.com/ido777/system-design-primer-update).  Click on the 'Fork' button near the top of the page.  This creates a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub server.

2. Clone this copy to your local disk:

        $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/system-design-primer.git
        $ cd system-design-primer

3. Create a branch to hold your changes and start making changes. Don't work in the `master` branch!

        $ git checkout -b my-feature

4. Work on this copy on your computer using Git to do the version control. When you're done editing, run the following to record your changes in Git:

        $ git add modified_files
        $ git commit

5. Push your changes to GitHub with:

        $ git push -u origin my-feature

6. Finally, go to the web page of your fork of the `system-design-primer` repo and click 'Pull Request' to send your changes for review.

### GitHub Pull Requests Docs

If you are not familiar with pull requests, review the [pull request docs](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

## Translations

Although the original repo included translation I prefer to keep it all in English.

### Why?

1) It seems to me that in 2025 there is no need for translations of static text - there are plenty of free tools to get good translations (e.g. google translate, genAI chats).
2) Looking at some of the translations status as of today it seems that anyway it wasn't updated.

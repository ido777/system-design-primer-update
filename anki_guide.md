# How to Use the Anki Flashcard Decks

This guide explains how to download and import the Anki flashcard decks provided in this repository to help you study system design concepts using spaced repetition.

## What is Anki?

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a powerful, free, and open-source flashcard program that makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.

## Step 1: Install Anki

You need to install the Anki application on your device first.

*   **Desktop (Recommended for Importing):** Download and install the latest version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) from the official Anki website: [https://apps.ankiweb.net/](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
*   **Mobile:**
    *   **Android:** Install [AnkiDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&hl=en_US&gl=US) from the Google Play Store.
    *   **iOS:** Purchase and install [AnkiMobile](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387) from the App Store (this is a paid app developed by the Anki creators to support the project).

## Step 2: Download the Decks

Download the `.apkg` deck files from this repository. You can find them in the `resources/flash_cards/` directory or use these direct links:

*   [System Design Deck](../resources/flash_cards/System%20Design.apkg?raw=true)
*   [System Design Exercises Deck](../resources/flash_cards/System%20Design%20Exercises.apkg?raw=true)
*   [Object Oriented Design Exercises Deck](../resources/flash_cards/OO%20Design.apkg?raw=true)

*(Clicking these links should initiate a download. If not, right-click and select "Save Link As...")*

If you have cloned the entire repository, you can find the files locally in the `resources/flash_cards/` subfolder.

## Step 3: Import the Decks into Anki

The easiest way to import is using the Anki desktop application.

1.  **Open Anki** on your computer.
2.  Go to **File > Import...**
3.  **Navigate** to where you downloaded the `.apkg` files.
4.  **Select** one of the deck files (e.g., `System Design.apkg`) and click **Open**.
5.  Anki will process the file and show an "Importing" dialog. Once finished, it will confirm how many notes were added or updated. Click **Close**.
6.  Repeat steps 2-5 for the other deck files you downloaded.

The decks will now appear in your Anki deck list.

## Step 4: Sync with Mobile (Optional)

If you want to study on your mobile device:

1.  **Create a free AnkiWeb account:** [https://ankiweb.net/](https://ankiweb.net/)
2.  **Sync your desktop Anki:** Click the "Sync" button in the top-right corner of the desktop Anki application and log in with your AnkiWeb account. This uploads your decks to AnkiWeb.
3.  **Sync your mobile Anki:** Open AnkiDroid or AnkiMobile, go to Settings > Account or Sync, and log in with the same AnkiWeb account. Perform a sync operation.

Your decks should now be available on your mobile device.

Happy studying!

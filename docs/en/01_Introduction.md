# The System Design Primer Update

## Introduction

This repo is about helping you to learn system design issues and prepare for the system design interview.

The repo currently includes mainly static content, but we are working on adding more dynamic and interactive content, like AI-assisted tools.

The content is organized under 3 assumptions:
 - The common reader will come here for mainly preparation for an interview, therefore the order of the content is organized for this purpose. 
 - Looking forward to become an interactive tool for learning system design and creating systems, the content should be organized to support this as well (e.g. small and focused sections instead of one monolithic file, with minimal assumption of prior knowledge).
 - Those who are looking for a refresher on system design concepts will find the content by searching or using the index or using the tools we will add (e.g assess your knowledge, practice with AI, etc). 


### Preparation for the system design interview

System design is a **required component** of the **technical interview process** at many tech companies.

First **Understand what is system design interview about** - many knowledgeable interviewees fails since they miss the essence of the system design interview which is different then the coding interview (even if done in the same session with the same interviewer). 

Second, based on your needs and background, **choose the right path** to prepare for the system design interview.

Make sure you **understand the basics of system design** and then **Practice common system design interview questions**, and **compare** your results with **sample solutions**.
Use **tools** to **memorize your learning** and to **simulate system design interview** to gain more confidence.


### Learn how to design large-scale systems

Learning how to design scalable systems will help you become a better engineer.

System design is a broad topic.  There is a **vast amount of resources scattered throughout the web** on system design principles.

This repo is an **organized collection** of resources and tools to help you to be prepared for the system design interview based on your timeline.

The vision is to become an interactive tool for learning system design and creating systems not only for the interview but also for your future work.

### How to use this repo

- if you are looking for preparation for the system design interview, you can use the study guide to get started.
- if you are looking for a refresher on system design concepts, you can use the index to find the section you are interested in.
- if you are looking for a more structured approach, stay tuned for the on line course (free, open source and self served) or... start helping to create it.

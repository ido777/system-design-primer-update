### Practice interactively 
The original repo used Anki - but it will be replaced soon with more modern platform:

*Anki* is a platform and tool for memorization using spaced repetition.
*Anki deck* is a collection of flashcards grouped under a single topic or category.
Anki uses: A form of the SM2 spaced repetition algorithm, originally developed for SuperMemo.
The algorithm:
- Adjusts when you see a card based on how well you recall it.
- Cards you get wrong are shown sooner.
- Cards you remember easily are delayed further (days, then weeks, then months).


The provided [Anki flashcard decks](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) use spaced repetition to help you retain key system design concepts.

See **[Guide to Using Anki Decks](anki_guide.md)** for instructions on how to download and import these files.

*   [System Design Exercises Deck](../../resources/flash_cards/System%20Design%20Exercises.apkg?raw=true)
*   [Object Oriented Design Exercises Deck](../../resources/flash_cards/OO%20Design.apkg?raw=true)

Great for use while on-the-go.

#### Coding Resource: Interactive Coding Challenges

Looking for resources to help you prep for the [**Coding Interview**](https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges)?



Check out the original sister repo [**Interactive Coding Challenges**](https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges), which contains an additional Anki deck:

* [Coding deck](https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges/tree/master/anki_cards/Coding.apkg)

For an alternative collection of Anki decks tailored specifically to developers, check out [Ankicode by daveight](https://github.com/daveight/ankicode)â€”a powerful resource that offers curated flashcards covering programming, algorithms, and other technical topics.
